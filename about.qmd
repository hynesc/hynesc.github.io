## My Background

I’m a master’s student in computer science at Georgia Tech. I earned my bachelor’s degree in economics and statistics from the University of South Carolina Honors College, where I focused on economic research.

Over time, I became especially interested in the data side of things — the tools, techniques, and systems that make analysis possible — which led me to pursue graduate study in computer science to deepen my technical expertise.

I’m interested in using data to answer open-ended questions, explore patterns, and support better decision-making — whether in tech, research, or policy. I’m also curious about economic systems and public policy, and how data can help us understand and improve them. I work primarily with Python and R to analyze data, build models, and communicate insights clearly and effectively.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing guitar (and trying to play a few other instruments), backpacking, and studying foreign languages. To date, I've traveled to 32 countries ([view the map here](assets/been.jpeg)). I’ve learned Spanish and German, and I’m currently learning French.

This site highlights some of the projects I’ve worked on during grad school and beyond.
